Hi <!-- REPLACE_WITH: First Name -->,

I saw your post about <!-- REPLACE_WITH: specific context - e.g., "hiring developers" or "digitalization challenges in SMEs" or "your company's recent growth" --> and wanted to connect!

I'm a full-stack developer building custom business systems for Singapore SMEs (invoicing tools, inventory management, booking systems). Recently deployed a Laravel-based invoice app that automates quotations and PDF generation: <!-- REPLACE_WITH: https://your-demo-app.onrender.com -->

Would love to connect and learn more about <!-- REPLACE_WITH: their company/industry/challenges -->!

## After Connection is Accepted (Follow-up Message)

Thanks for connecting, <!-- REPLACE_WITH: First Name -->!

Quick intro: I'm a <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Malaysian-based or your location --> Laravel developer helping Singapore SMEs digitalize manual workflows. I build internal tools like invoice systems, CRMs, inventory trackers — basically anything that gets stuck in Excel hell.

Here's a **live demo** of an invoice management system I recently built: <!-- REPLACE_WITH: https://your-demo-app.onrender.com -->

If <!-- REPLACE_WITH: their company name --> ever needs custom dev work (or you know someone who does), I'd love to chat! I offer competitive rates vs SG-based devs (based in <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Malaysia/your location -->), and I'm comfortable with tight deadlines.

No pressure — just wanted to share in case it's ever relevant. Happy to connect anyway! 😊

Cheers,
