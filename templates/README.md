# Freelance Outreach Templates - Usage Guide

This directory contains ready-to-use templates for landing your first freelance clients in Singapore. All templates use `<!-- REPLACE_WITH: -->` markers to show what you need to customize.

---

## 📄 Templates Overview

| Template | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `proposal-template.md` | Full project proposal | After initial client conversation when they ask for a quote |
| `cold-email-smb.md` | Email to Singapore SMEs | Outbound outreach to small/medium businesses |
| `cold-email-agency.md` | Email to dev agencies | Positioning yourself as subcontractor/overflow capacity |
| `linkedin-message.md` | LinkedIn connection request | Networking on LinkedIn (includes follow-up message) |

---

## 🚀 How to Use These Templates

### Step 1: Fill in ALL `<!-- REPLACE_WITH: -->` markers

Each template has placeholders like:
```markdown
<!-- REPLACE_WITH: Your Name -->
<!-- REPLACE_WITH: your.email@domain.com -->
<!-- REPLACE_WITH: Client Company Name -->
```

**Important:**
- ❌ Don't leave any placeholder unfilled
- ❌ Don't delete the `<!-- -->` comments until AFTER you've filled them in (helps you spot what's missing)
- ✅ Replace the entire marker including the comment tags

**Example:**
```markdown
Before: Hi <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Contact First Name -->,
After:  Hi Sarah,
```

### Step 2: Customize for Each Client

**DON'T just find-and-replace your name and email globally.** Each outreach message should be personalized:

- **Research the company** — What do they do? What problems might they have?
- **Reference something specific** — "Saw your LinkedIn post about hiring" / "Read about your new branch opening"
- **Tailor the pain points** — E-commerce company? Talk about inventory. Service business? Talk about booking systems.

**Generic template = ignored. Personalized message = reply rate 10x higher.**

## 📋 Template-Specific Tips

### `proposal-template.md` — Project Proposal

**When to send:**
- After initial discovery call/meeting
- Client has confirmed budget/timeline ballpark
- You understand their requirements clearly

**How to customize:**
1. **Problem Statement** — Use THEIR words from your conversation ("You mentioned you're wasting 5 hours/week on manual invoicing...")
2. **Proposed Solution** — Be specific about deliverables (not just "I'll build an app")
3. **Timeline** — Be realistic. Better to over-deliver than miss deadlines.
4. **Pricing** — Reference Singapore market rates:
   - Small features: SGD 200-1,000
   - Internal tools: SGD 1,500-8,000
   - Full apps: SGD 5,000-15,000+

**Pro tip:** Include a **live demo link** (your deployed app) so they can see your work quality immediately.

### `cold-email-smb.md` — Cold Outreach to SMEs

**Who to target:**
- Small/medium businesses in Singapore (10-100 employees)
- Industries: retail, F&B, logistics, professional services, healthcare
- Companies still using Excel/manual workflows

**Where to find them:**
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (filter by company size + location)
- Singapore business directories (Kompass, Yellow Pages SG)
- Industry associations (Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, SME Centre@SMF)

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Keep it under 200 words (they're busy)
- ✅ Lead with a pain point they recognize ("manual invoicing is slow")
- ✅ Include your demo link (proof of skills)
- ✅ Clear CTA ("Reply with 'Interested'")
- ❌ Don't oversell — focus on one specific problem
- ❌ Don't attach files (emails with attachments get flagged as spam)

**Follow-up strategy:**
- Send cold email
- Wait 3 business days
- If no reply, send short follow-up: "Hi [Name], following up on my email from [day]. Still interested in cutting invoice processing time? Happy to show you a quick demo!"
- If still no reply after 2nd email, move on

### `cold-email-agency.md` — Subcontracting with Agencies

**Who to target:**
- Singapore digital agencies (web dev, app dev, marketing agencies that build websites)
- Companies listed on platforms like Clutch.co, GoodFirms, or Singapore Business Review

**Why agencies hire freelancers:**
- Overflow work (their in-house team is fully booked)
- Special skills (Laravel expert for a PHP project)
- Cost savings (cheaper than hiring full-time)

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Emphasize **fast delivery** and **reliable communication**
- ✅ Mention you're comfortable with **white-label work** (delivering under their brand)
- ✅ Include GitHub profile (they'll want to see your code quality)
- ✅ Be clear about rates and availability
- ❌ Don't bad-mouth other contractors/agencies
- ❌ Don't oversell your experience (they'll test you on first project)

**Pro tip:** Agencies care more about **reliability** than **cheapest price**. Highlight that you deliver on time and communicate proactively.

### `linkedin-message.md` — LinkedIn Networking

**Two versions included:**
1. **Connection request message** (< 300 characters due to LinkedIn limit without Premium)
2. **Follow-up message** (send after they accept your connection)

**Best practices:**
- ✅ Reference something specific from their profile ("Saw your post about...")
- ✅ Keep connection request SHORT (LinkedIn truncates long messages)
- ✅ Wait 1-2 days after they accept before sending follow-up
- ✅ Don't pitch immediately — build relationship first
- ❌ Don't use InMail unless they're not accepting connections
- ❌ Don't send generic "I'd like to add you to my professional network" messages

**Who to connect with:**
- CTOs, Heads of Product, Operations Managers at SMEs
- Founders of startups (they make purchasing decisions fast)
- Fellow developers (referrals are powerful)

## 💰 Pricing Guide (Singapore Market)

Use these ranges when filling in `<!-- REPLACE_WITH: pricing -->`:

| Project Type | Typical Range (SGD) | Example |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Small feature** | 200-1,000 | "Add export to Excel button to existing app" |
| **Internal tool** | 1,500-8,000 | "Custom invoice management system" |
| **Full web app** | 5,000-15,000 | "E-commerce site with inventory + payment gateway" |
| **Hourly rate** | 30-120 | Depends on experience (beginner: 30-50, experienced: 80-120) |

**Malaysian advantage:** As a Malaysian developer, you can charge 20-40% less than Singapore-based developers while still making good money (SGD 1 = MYR 3.3-3.5). This makes you VERY competitive.

**Pricing strategy for beginners:**
- First 1-2 clients: Charge on the **lower end** (build portfolio + testimonials)
- After 3-5 successful projects: Increase rates by 30-50%
- Once you have strong portfolio: Charge market rate (SGD 60-80/hour)

## 🎯 Before You Start Sending

**Make sure you have:**
- [ ] Deployed demo app (your invoice system on Render)

- [ ] Portfolio page live (see Task 13 — we'll create this within the app)
- [ ] WhatsApp Business account (optional but recommended for SG market)

**Test your demo:**
- [ ] Visit your live Render URL — does it load?

## 🆘 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sending the same generic message to everyone**
   - ❌ "Hi, I'm a developer. Need a website?"
   - ✅ "Hi Sarah, saw your post about manual invoicing at ABC Trading. I built a system that automates this..."

2. **Talking about yourself instead of their problems**
   - ❌ "I have 5 years of experience in Laravel and React..."
   - ✅ "Most businesses waste 10 hours/week on invoice data entry. I can cut that to 30 minutes..."

3. **No clear call-to-action**
   - ❌ "Let me know if you're interested."
   - ✅ "Reply with 'Interested' and I'll send my calendar link for a free 15-minute call."

4. **Overselling/overpromising**
   - ❌ "I can build anything in any technology!"
   - ✅ "I specialize in Laravel-based internal tools — here's a live demo of similar work."

5. **Following up too aggressively**
   - ❌ Sending daily emails after no response
   - ✅ One follow-up after 3 days, then move on
