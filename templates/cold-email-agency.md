# Cold Email Template: Singapore Dev Agencies

**Subject:** Laravel contractor available for overflow/subcontracting work

---

Hi <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Hiring Manager / Agency Owner Name -->,

I'm a <!-- REPLACE_WITH: "Malaysian-based" or your location --> full-stack developer specializing in **Laravel + Livewire** projects, and I'm reaching out to see if <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Agency Name --> ever needs extra hands for client work or has overflow projects that need fast delivery.

**My Background:**
- <!-- REPLACE_WITH: X years --> building business systems and internal tools with Laravel
- Strong with: Laravel 11/12, Livewire, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL/MySQL, REST APIs
- <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Optional - "Previously worked on X type of projects" or "Experience with Y industry" -->
- Fast turnaround (comfortable with tight deadlines)
- Clean, maintainable code (no over-engineering — I follow Laravel best practices)

**Live Portfolio:** <!-- REPLACE_WITH: https://your-demo-app.onrender.com/portfolio -->  
This is a full invoice management system I built as a demo — shows CRUD, PDF generation, database relationships, responsive UI, and deployment skills.

**How I Can Help:**
- **White-label subcontracting** — I deliver work under your agency brand (you bill the client, I invoice you)
- **Overflow capacity** — When your in-house team is swamped, I can take on smaller features or modules
- **Fast prototyping** — Need a quick MVP for a pitch? I can build functional demos in 1-2 weeks

**Rates:** SGD <!-- REPLACE_WITH: 40-80 depending on project complexity -->/hour or fixed-price per feature/module (typically 20-30% lower than Singapore-based contractors). Based in <!-- REPLACE_WITH: Malaysia/your location -->, so competitive pricing while maintaining quality.

**Availability:** <!-- REPLACE_WITH: e.g., "20-30 hours/week" or "Full-time for the right project" -->

Would you be open to keeping me on your roster for future projects? Happy to jump on a quick call to discuss how we could work together.

**Reply or WhatsApp me** at <!-- REPLACE_WITH: +60/+65 number --> if this sounds useful!

Best,
