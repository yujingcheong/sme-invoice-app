=== EMPTY STATE TEST (No 500 Errors) ===

Test: Dashboard and Customer pages with empty database
Date: 2026-02-27
Database: All customers, invoices, quotations cleared

Test Method:
1. Cleared all data using artisan tinker:
   - App\Models\Invoice::truncate()
   - App\Models\Quotation::truncate()
   - App\Models\Customer::truncate()

2. Accessed pages through browser (authenticated session)
   - Dashboard: /dashboard
   - Customer List: /customers

Expected Behavior:
✓ Pages should render without 500 errors
✓ Dashboard shows zero counts for stats (0 invoices, $ 0.00 revenue, etc.)
✓ Dashboard shows empty state messages for recent items
✓ Customer list shows "No customers yet" message
✓ Customer list shows "Add Your First Customer" call-to-action

Result: PASS
- No PHP errors or exceptions thrown
- Components handle empty collections gracefully using @if($collection->isEmpty())
- Empty state UI renders correctly with helpful messages
- No division by zero errors (conversion rate handles 0 quotations)
- SGD formatting handles 0.00 correctly

Notes:
- Livewire 4 functional components work correctly with empty data
- The with() method returns empty collections that Blade handles properly
- withCount() returns 0 for relationships when no related records exist
- sum() returns null which is coalesced to 0 using ?? operator
